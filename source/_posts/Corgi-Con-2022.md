I discovered [Corgi Con](https://corgicon.com/) after asking my coworkers about what to do in San Francisco on the weekends. In the nick of time too, since it was this Saturday! The event is exactly what it sounds like -- hundreds of corgis and corgi owners gathering on Ocean Beach for a fluff-filled day. Anyway, enjoy some cute photos that I took at the event.
