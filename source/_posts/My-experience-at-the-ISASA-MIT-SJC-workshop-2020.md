Hi everyone! Recently, I had the great privilege of attending the ISASA-MIT-SJC workshop at St John's College *insert rest*

Here are some of my thoughts about the programme.

## Day 1

### Workshop 1 -- Intro to Entrepreneurship

Maybe I've just heard the word "entrepreneurship" too many times, but this workshop wasn't too interesting for me.

We did get to pitch some cool designs though, which was pretty cool.

### Workshop 2 -- Space in Media

In this workshop, we debunked some myths about space, such as the true colour of the sun. We even played a Kahoot about these myths at the beginning!

My mind was blown quite a few times during this, although it felt a lot like facts just being listed instead of really engaging content that I was hoping for. However, I did learn how pop culture has subtly influenced my perception about space, despite me not even having *that* much exposure to pop culture about space.

What was also interesting was finding out that pop culture isn't *that* wrong about space, such as ion engines being a real thing and how many phenomena shown in films (like Tatooine's binary star system) are actually real phenomena.

### Workshop 3 -- Material Science

This was a pretty interesting workshop for me. I've never done any material science before and it was interesting seeing how physical properties like elasticity could be quantified and measured with equations.

Apparently MIT is very proud of their material sciences department and I can see why.

### Workshop 4 -- The Engineering Design Process

This workshop was very similar to the entrepreneurship workshop, but in this case we had to "solve" an actual problem that astronauts faced.

In my opinion, this was much more educational since the concepts and steps were explained in much more detail.

## Day 2

### Workshop 1 -- 

### Workshop 2 -- Astrophysics

Don't let the name fool you -- this class was actually about nuclear physics. Nevertheless, it was quite fascinating as I don't have any experience in that field either.

We got to play *Jeopardy!* at the end and my team won, so it was a fun time.

### Workshop 3 -- Orbital Mechanics

### Workshop 4 -- Python

So since I already know Python pretty well, I just did my own problems during this :P

(I did help other people who were struggling though)

## Day 3

(I was actually not present for the majority of this day, since I had a school event :P)

### Workshop 3 -- Microgravity

Basically this workshop was about designing experiments to test how things work in microgravity. We were shown 4 main ways and their pros/cons.

We got to design some experiments of our own. I found this very difficult but the experiments proposed by others were quite creative and interesting.

### Night Activity -- Astronomy Talk
