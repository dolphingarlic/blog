I know I've been neglecting this blog ~~for the past two years~~ a little bit, but I've decided to pick it back up over this summer! I'm going to start interning for [Scale AI](https://scale.com/) in San Francisco next week, so I'll probably write about that. I'm also going through old [3.033](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/3-024-electronic-optical-and-magnetic-properties-of-materials-spring-2013/ "Electrical, Optical, and Magnetic Properties of Materials") lectures in preparation for my UROP next fall, so I'll also use this blog to jot down what I've learnt.

There's always the possibility that I either forget about this blog again or become too busy to write new posts, but I'm hoping to revive it and continue writing even after this summer. In the meantime, stay tuned for more!
