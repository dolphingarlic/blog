# $\xi$

This is the lowercase Greek letter "xi". It's used all over the place in maths and physics, and it also looks very cool. However, I am not the best at writing it.

Because of this, I've come up with a few strategies to improve how I write the letter.

# Strategy 1 -- Just Get Goodâ„¢

Well this isn't happening anytime soon. I have the whole summer left to practice though, so maybe it will happen by the time I have to write equations for other people to see.

My friend Steven is really good at writing $\xi$ (and all other Greek letters for that matter), and apparently he used this strategy in high school. For more immediate results though...

# Strategy 2 -- Draw $\varepsilon$, But Badly

A few minutes into drawing my beautiful image above, I realized that $\xi$ looked quite similar to $\varepsilon$. Because of this, I tried employing this new strategy.

And it works!

... kind of.

Sometimes I miss a loop, and sometimes I draw a loop too many. I also can't seem to get the spacing between the loops and the curvy tail quite right, so a lot of my letters just look like little spirals.

Overall though, this method seems to work well enough, so I think I'm going to stick with it for now.

# Strategy 3 -- Give Up and Draw Squiggles

Honestly, this isn't all that different from what I'm doing right now. Since $\xi$ *is* so infamously difficult to write though, I definitely wouldn't be alone in this camp.
